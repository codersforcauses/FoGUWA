As a result, several micronutrients that are readily available for uptake by roots become poorly available. As a result, the leaves that need these micronutrients, become ‘chlorotic’ i.e. loss of the normal green coloration of leaves of plants, characterised by pale leaf lamina. If no action is taken, the trees will succumb, which sadly happened with many jarrahs that would have been older than the university itself. The cure is easy and cheap – acidify the soil back to its original pH by spreading iron sulfate below the canopy.",

As a result, the irrihgation water is alkaline, and this raises the pH of the soil, and renders micronutrients such as iron , manganese, zinc and copper poorly available. Species such as jarrah and banksias are adapted to acidic soils, and cannot cope with an increase in soil pH. Their leaves turn yellow, branches die, and eventually the trees succumb. The cure is easy and cheap: acidify the soil back to its original pH. That can be done by spreading iron sulfate below the canopy.  Friends of the Grounds have done exactly that, and thus stopped further decline of some of the affected trees. Volunteers are welcome to assist with this activity.",

Despite claims that the toxin is only in the seeds, the sarcotesta of Macrozamia riedlii actually shows 10 times higher concentrations in the sarcotesta than in the kernels (Ladd et al., 1993). Native animals do consume the sarcotesta, without obvious harm, but it is not known what their resistance to macrozamin may be based on. Emus (Dromaius novaehollandiae) carry the zamia seeds over vast distances, and appear to be important in their dispersal (Calviño-Cancela et al., 2006). Aboriginal people throughout Australia knew how to prepare the seeds or sarcotesta to reduce the toxin levels. It appears that in the southwest, Noongar people consumed the sarcotesta, whereas elsewhere in Australia they used the kernels.",

Sweet (1830)\nFamily: Myrtaceae\nOrder: Myrtales\nThree botanical varieties are recognised: var. angustifolia differs from the typical var. flexuosa in having long, narrow leaves, while var. latifolia has short, broad leaves.\nSeveral selected forms of A. flexuosa are available. Popular cultivars include 'Nana', a compact form to about 4 metres, 'Variegata', a form with variegated foliage (seen in Kings Park by the toilets nearest to the boabab tree) and 'After Dark', a form with deep burgundy to purple foliage.\nThis species is regarded as a weed in all other Australian States due to its incredible ability to survive in multiple different environments and is quite invasive.\nThe plant will live in soils of various types; calcareous, sandy, loam, clay, and granitic. Near-coastal areas.\nIt is an incredibly useful plant in its native range of distribution:\na. It serves as a stabiliser for moving sand dunes\nb. It provides a windbreak and is often sculpted by such forces\nc. It provides a humus layer to soil, useful after fire for new species\nd. It provides dense thickets for protective cover for many animal species\ne. It serves to establish plant life on new and exposed soils\nf. It provides an oil from its leaves with a pungent odour (possible perfume / aroma uses ?)\ng. It provides a good rehabilitation tree and street tree in coastal areas only in the South West of Western Australia\nh. It provides abundant flowers for insects (nectar)(possible implications for the honey industry)",
